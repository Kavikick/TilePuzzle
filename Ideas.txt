Slide puzzle

Start with a picture and create a puzzle of NxN where we can move scrambled pieces around to complete the puzzle

research:
Animate the squares
Pictures in objects

Objects:
Board
	Properties:
	2D Array of pieces (Each piec)

	Swap a piece
Piece
	Properties:
	A picture
	ID
	

Ideas:
    Use the svelte transition like the tutorial for the moving list
    Make picture objects

Each square is an object primarily and then the svelte components are created rom the objects
	If we give each object an ID (Puzzle piece number) then we can avoid the situation where the picture 	doesn’t follow the object

Use a store for all of the objects
Use objects to create the components
Each svelte component has a picture
Create a list of all the objects

The cursor square (the black one) is just a place holder and has no behavior just a picture like any other

The board knows where the border is and the square has to ask the board if it can move in a specific direction

Have to click the tile you want to go to
	This triggers an event that the board intercepts and decides if the black piece can move
		the board looks at the piece’s neighbors and if any of them is the infamous black square it changes places

BONUS POINTS:
	If you click in same row or column then all the pieces between including the clicked one
